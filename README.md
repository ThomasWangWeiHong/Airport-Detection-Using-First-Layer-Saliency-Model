# Airport-Detection-Using-First-Layer-Saliency-Model
Python implementation of algorithm proposed in academia

This function is an implementation of the First Layer Saliency (FLS) model which is used to detect airport regions in images containing 
airport, as proposed in the paper 'Airport Detection and Aircraft Recognition Based on Two - Layer Saliency Model in High Spatial 
Resolution Remote - Sensing Images' by Zhang L., Zhang Y. (2017)

This function makes use of the butterworth high - pass filter which is implemented in the package psychopy. Full details on the 
installation and use of the package is detailed in http://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/introduction.html.

Requirements:
- cv2
- numpy
- psychopy
- rasterio
- scipy
- skimage
